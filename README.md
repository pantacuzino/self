Hello,

There are several ways to introduce yourself as a person:

1. Your name, your title or job description
2. Your name, what you do
3. Your name, what you like, what you dislike, what you hope to do, how you spend your life

or I am Bogdan and I've never had a CV. My likes, interests stem from what I actively do, not from I want the world to perceive I do.

Introductions are hard, let's skip pass the introductions phase.
